You will first be shown a target vowel on the screen, and
then played a series of vowels.

When you hear the target vowel press the "t" key. If you
hear a vowel that is not the target vowel, press the "n"
key. An "x" symbol will appear while each vowel is playing
to indicate when you may submit a response.

You will need to listen carefully to each vowel as they
will be presented quickly.
