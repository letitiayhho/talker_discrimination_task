In each trial, you will be asked to identify whether 
pairs of vowels are spoken by the same talker.
A fixation cross "+" will appear to indicate the start
of each trial. After the fixation cross, two vowels will 
be played to you. 
If you think the vowels were spoken by the same
talker, press the "4" button, if they were spoken by
different talkers, press the "1" button.
An "x" will appear after the vowels are played to 
indicate when you should enter your response.
Take your time and try to respond as accurately as possible.
