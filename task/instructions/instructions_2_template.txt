In each trial, you will be asked to identify whether 
pairs of vowels are spoken by the same talker.
A fixation cross "+" will appear to indicate the start
of each trial. After the fixation cross, two vowels will 
be played to you. Once the vowels are presented, an "x"
will appear, indicating when you should enter your 
response. If you think the vowels were spoken by the same
talker, press the "<same>" key, if they were spoken by
different talkers, press the "<different>" key.
Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
