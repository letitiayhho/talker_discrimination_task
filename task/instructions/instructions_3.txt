While you are listening to the vowels please 
remain as still as possible, as movements
(even slight head movements and eye blinks)
will interfere with the data you are providing.

Each trial will begin with a fixation cross "+", 
if you have to move at any time during the experiment
please confine this activity to when the "+" is shown.
Press any key during the "+" to begin the next trial.
